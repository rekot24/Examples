Foreground vs Background
color | Foreground color is the color that an element appears in. For example,
  when a heading is styled to appear green, the foreground color of the heading
  has been styled.
background-color | Conversely, when a heading is styled so that its background
  appears yellow, the background color of the heading has been styled

Hexadecimal
  One syntax that we can use to specify colors is called hexadecimal. Colors
    specified using this system are called hex colors. A hex color begins with a
    hash character (#) which is followed by three or six characters. The
    characters represent values for red, blue and green.
  DarkSeaGreen: #8FBC8F
  Sienna:       #A0522D
  SaddleBrown:  #8B4513
  Brown:        #A52A2A
  Black:        #000000 or #000
  Aqua:         #00FFFF or #0FF
Example:
  background-color: #9932cc;

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RGB colors
color: rgb(23, 45, 23);
Here, each of the three values represents a color component, and each can have a
  decimal number value from 0 to 255. The first number represents the amount of
  red, the second is green, and the third is blue. These colors are exactly the
  same as hex, but with a different syntax and a different number system.

In general, hex and decimal color representations are equivalent. Which you
  choose is a matter of personal taste. That said, it's good to choose one and
  be consistent throughout your CSS, because it's easier to compare hex to hex
  and decimal to decimal.

Hue, Saturation, and Lightness
The RGB color scheme is convenient because it's very close to how computers
  represent colors internally. There's another equally powerful system in CSS
  called the hue-saturation-lightness color scheme, abbreviated as HSL.

The syntax for HSL is similar to the decimal form of RGB, though it differs in
  important ways. The first number represents the degree of the hue, and can be
  between 0 and 360. The second and third numbers are percentages representing
  saturation and lightness respectively. Here is an example:
color: hsl(120, 60%, 70%);
Hue is the first number. It refers to an angle on a color wheel. Red is 0
  degrees, Green is 120 degrees, Blue is 240 degrees, and then back to Red at
  360.
Saturation refers to the intensity or purity of the color. If you imagine a line
  segment drawn from the center of the color wheel to the perimeter, the
  saturation is a point on that line segment. If you spin that line segment to
  different angles, you'll see how that saturation looks for different hues.
  The saturation increases towards 100% as the point gets closer to the edge
  (the color becomes more rich). The saturation decreases towards 0% as the
  point gets closer to the center (the color becomes more gray).
Lightness refers to how light or dark the color is. Halfway, or 50%, is normal
  lightness. Imagine a sliding dimmer on a light switch that starts halfway.
  Sliding the dimmer up towards 100% makes the color lighter, closer to white.
  Sliding the dimmer down towards 0% makes the color darker, closer to black.
HSL is convenient for adjusting colors. In RGB, making the color a little darker
  may affect all three color components. In HSL, that's as easy as changing the
  lightness value. HSL is also useful for making a set of colors that work well
  together by selecting various colors that have the same lightness and
  saturation but different hues.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Opacity and Alpha
When we overlap two opaque elements, nothing from the bottom element shows
  through the top element. We can change the opacity, or the amount of
  transparency, of some colors so that some or all of the bottom elements are
  visible through a covering element.
To use opacity in the HSL color scheme, use hsla instead of hsl, and four values
  instead of three. For example:
color: hsla(34, 100%, 50%, 0.1);

The first three values work the same as hsl. The fourth value is the alpha.
  This last value is sometimes called the opacity.
Alpha is a decimal number from zero to one. If alpha is zero, the color will be
  completely transparent. If alpha is one, the color will be opaque. The value for
  half transparent would be 0.5
When a color's alpha is below one, any color behind it will be blended in. The
  blending happens for each pixel; no blurring occurs.

The RGB color scheme has a similar syntax for opacity, rgba. Again, the first
  three values work the same as rgb and the last value is the alpha. Here's an
  example:
color: rgba(234, 45, 98, 0.33);
  Alpha can only be used with HSL and RGB colors; we cannot add the alpha value
  to color: green color: #FFFFF.
