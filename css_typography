Linking Fonts
With the number of fonts available with modern typography, it is unrealistic to
  expect users to have all fonts installed on their computers. New fonts are
  often centralized in directories made available for public use. We refer to
  these fonts as non-user fonts.
  Google Fonts is one such directory of thousands of open-source fonts, available
  for free use. Google Fonts gives us a way to retrieve the link for a single
  font, multiple fonts, or multiple fonts with the font-weight and font-style
  properties.
When we have the link to the font of our choice, we can add the font to the
  <head> section of the HTML document, using the <link> tag and the href.
Example:
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Droid+Serif" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet">
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Font-Face
There are other ways to link non-user fonts that don't require the use of the
  <link> tag in the HTML document. CSS offers a way to import fonts directly
  into stylesheets with the @font-face property.

To load fonts with the @font-face property:
- Instead of using the font's link in the HTML document, enter the link into the
  URL bar in the browser.
- The browser will load the CSS rules. You will need to focus on the rules that
  are directly labeled as /* latin */. Some of the latin rules are on separate
  lines. You will need each of these.
- Copy each of the CSS rules labeled latin, and paste the rules from the browser
  to the top of style.css.
It is important to stress the need to copy the @font-face rules to the top of
  the stylesheet for the font to load correctly in the project.

Font-Face - Local repository
While Google Fonts and other resources can broaden font selection, you may wish
  to use an entirely different font or abstain from using a font from an
  external service.
We can modify our @font-face rule to use local font files as well. We can supply
  the user with the desired font family and host it along with our site instead
  of depending on a different site.
- The main difference is the use of a relative filepath instead of a web URL.
- We add a format for each file to specify which font to use. Different browsers
  support different font types, so providing multiple font file options will
  support more browsers.
Example:
@font-face {
  font-family: "Roboto";
  src: url(fonts/Roboto.woff2) format('woff2'),
       url(fonts/Roboto.woff) format('woff'),
       url(fonts/Roboto.tff) format('truetype');
}
Use one of the 3 listed methods
As of now .woff2 appears to be the way of the future, due to greatly reduced file
  sizes and improved performance, but many browsers still donâ€™t support it.

Bullet Points
- Typography is the art of arranging text on a page.
- Text can appear in any number of weights, with the font-weight property.
- Text can appear in italics with the font-style property.
- The vertical spacing between lines of text can be modified with the line-height
  property.
- Serif fonts have extra details on the ends of each letter. Sans-Serif fonts
  do not.
- Fallback fonts are used when a certain font is not installed on a user's
  computer.
- Google Fonts provides free fonts that can be used in an HTML file with the
  <link> tag or the @font-face property.
- Local fonts can be added to a document with the @font-face property and the
  path to the font's source.
- The word-spacing property changes how far apart individual words are.
- The letter-spacing property changes how far apart individual letters are.
- The text-align property changes where text horizontally on a page.
