Block-level elements create a block the full width of their parent elements,
  and they prevent other elements from appearing in the same horizontal space.
  The default position of an element can be changed by setting it's position
  property with one of 4 values:
  - static (default)
  - relative | Allows you to position an element relative to its default static
      position on the web page using 4 available properties. Can be specified in
      pixels, ems, or percentages. These offset properties will not work if the
      element's position property is static
  - absolute | All other elements on the page will ignore the element and act like
      it is not present on the page.  The element will be positioned relative to
      its closest positioned parent element. Can use the 4 properties above.
  - fixed | remains in a fixed position, regardless of scrolling

Offset properties, 4 available properties. Can be specified in
  pixels, ems, or percentages. These offset properties will not work if the
  element's position property is static
  - top - moves the element down
  - bottom - moves the element up
  - left - moves the element right
  - right - moves the element left
p {
  position: relative;
  top: 20px;
  left: 50px;
}

z-index | Controls overlap priority with 1 being highest.

Display | 3 properties available.  Inline, block, inline-Block
  - inline | Browser will render elements on the same line as other inline
      elements immediately before or after them. Default for a, em, strong.
      Cannot alter size with height or width properties

  - block | not displayed on the same line as content around them.  Fills them
      entire width of the page by default, but width can be set.

  - inline-block | can appear next to other elements and can have dimensions
      specified using width & height. images are the best example of this type.

float | can be set to left or right.  must have a width set or won't do anything.

clear | float can be used on multiple elements at once. when multiple elements
  have different heights they can "bump" into each other and not allow other
  elements to properly move left or right. clear tells them how to behave when
  this happens. 4 possible settings:
  - left | left side of element will not touch any other element within the same
      containing element.
  - right | the right side of the element will not touch any other element
      within the same containing element.
  - both | neither side of the element will touch any other element within the
      same containing element.
  - none | the element can touch either side.
