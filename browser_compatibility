All browsers have a default set of CSS rules that they apply to HTML. The default
CSS rules live in a stylesheet specific to the browser. The stylesheet is known
as a user agent style sheet.

Resetting User Agent Stylesheets

1 - Create a reset.css file.
2 - Copy and paste CSS reset rules into the reset.css file.
3 - Link to reset.css in the HTML file (make sure reset.css is loaded first before
    other CSS files, otherwise reset.css may reset your custom rules by accident).

Browser support
To avoid inconsistencies across browsers when creating a website, developers
must ensure that newer HTML or CSS features are supported in each browser.
The following resource is an up-to-date record of CSS properties across many
versions of many browsers:

Global Support vs Unprefixed Support
every browser has its own implementation of many newer CSS rules. To distinguish
their own implementation, browsers add a prefix to the CSS property. The prefix
is known as a vendor prefix. For example, the -moz vendor prefix refers to Mozilla
Firefox's implementation.
To identify exactly which CSS properties need vendor prefixes, you can use tools
