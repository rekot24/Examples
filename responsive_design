em | Incorporating relative sizing starts by using units other than pixels. If
the base font of a browser is 16 pixels (which is normal default size), then
1em = 16px.  ex: font-size: 2em; (default settings this would be 32px)

rem | Rem stands for root em. It acts similar to em, but instead of checking
parent elements to size font, it checks the root element. The root element is
the <html> tag. Can set root with the css rule - html {font-size: 20px;}

Percentages: Height & Width. Used to size non-text elements relative to their
parent elements. Percentages are often used to size box-model values, like width
and height, padding, border, and margins. They can also be used to set positioning
properties (top, bottom, left, right). When percentages are used, elements are
sized relative to the dimensions of their parent element. Because the box model
includes padding, borders, and margins, setting an element's width to 100% may
cause content to overflow its parent container

Percentages: Padding & Margin. When percentages are used to set padding and
margin, they are calculated based only on the width of the parent element. When
a property like margin-left is set using a percentage (say 50%), the element
will be moved halfway to the right in the parent container (as opposed to the
child element receiving a margin half of its parent's margin). Vertical padding
and margin are also calculated based on the width of the parent.
NOTE: When using relative sizing, ems and rems should be used to size text and
dimensions on the page related to text size (i.e. padding around text). This
creates a consistent layout based on text size. Otherwise, percentages should
be used.

Width & Height: Max & Min - good to use to ensure text does not become too compressed or
very spread out and difficult to read. pixels is used to ensure hard limits on
the dimensions of elements. min-width max-width min-height max-height
