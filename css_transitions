These changes are a type of state change. CSS transitions allow us to control
 the timing of visual state changes. We can control the following four aspects
 of an element's transition:
- Which CSS properties transition
- How long a transition lasts
- How much time there is before a transition begins
- How a transition accelerates
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Duration
To create a simple transition in CSS, we must specify two of the four aspects:
- The property that we want to transition.
- The duration of the transition.
Example:
a {
  transition-property: color;
  transition-duration: 1s;
}
