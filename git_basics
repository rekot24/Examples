git commands are issued in the terminal window (BASH)
Basic Git Workflow
1. git init > 2. git add > 3. git commit

1. Working directory
  - Make changes to files: additions, deletions, modifications

2. Staging Area
  - Files are ready for commit

3. Repository
  - Changes are saved to repository as a commit

git status
  - prints a log of the changes that have occurred in the current version of a project
git add your_filename
  - adds a file to the staging area
git add .
  - adds all files and directories in the pwd


git commit -m "Changes to code comment here"
  - a good commit message is also written:
    - in quotation marks
    - in present tense
    - in 50 characters or less when using -m

Remote git creation.  github.com
  - create new Repository
  - give description
  - copy quick setup to clipboard

git remote add origin https://github.com/rekot24/sorcerer-s-code.git
  - origin is an alias for the remote repository for easy future reference

git remote -v
  - lists all the git remotes and their corresponding URLs
  - the URL marked "fetch" is the remote repository that git is reading
    from, and the URL marked "push" is the repository git is writing to

git push -u origin master
  - git push - informs git that we want to update a remote Repository
  - origin - refers to the remote repository we are pushing on to github
  - master - refers to the place where are work lives on our local Repository
  - -u stands for "upstream". by writing the command with the upstream option
    we establish a link between the local repo and the remote master branch
    -u is only used the first time we push to the remote repository
  - will be prompted for username/password for github
