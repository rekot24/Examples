  Used to detect the size of the current screen and apply different CSS styles
  depending on the width of the screen.

@media only screen and (max-width: 480px) {
  body {
    font-size: 12px;
  }
}

- @media | keyword begins a media query rule and instructs the CSS compiler on
  how to parse the rest of the rule
- on screen | Indicates what type of devices should use this rule. Screen is the
  media type always used for displaying content, no matter the type of device.
  The only keyword indicates this rule only applies to one media type (screen).
- and (max-width: 480px) | This part of the rule is called the media feature,
  and instructs the CSS compiler to apply the CSS to relevent devices.
- CSS rules are then nested inside curly braces
