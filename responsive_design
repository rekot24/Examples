em | Incorporating relative sizing starts by using units other than pixels. If
the base font of a browser is 16 pixels (which is normal default size), then
1em = 16px.  ex: font-size: 2em; (default settings this would be 32px)

rem | Rem stands for root em. It acts similar to em, but instead of checking
parent elements to size font, it checks the root element. The root element is
the <html> tag. Can set root with the css rule - html {font-size: 20px;}

Percentages can be used to size non-text elements relative to their parent
elements. Percentages are often used to size box-model values, like width and
height, padding, border, and margins. They can also be used to set positioning
properties (top, bottom, left, right). When percentages are used, elements are
sized relative to the dimensions of their parent element. Because the box model
includes padding, borders, and margins, setting an element's width to 100% may
cause content to overflow its parent container
