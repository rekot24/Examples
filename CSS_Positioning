Block-level elements create a block the full width of their parent elements,
  and they prevent other elements from appearing in the same horizontal space.
  The default position of an element can be changed by setting it's position
  property with one of 4 values:
  - static (default)
  - relative
  - absolute
  - fixed

relative | Allows you to position an element relative to its default static
  position on the web page using 4 available properties. Can be specified in
  pixels, ems, or percentages. These offset properties will not work if the
  element's position property is static
  - top - moves the element down
  - bottom - moves the element up
  - left - moves the element right
  - right - moves the element left
p {
  position: relative;
  top: 20px;
  left: 50px;
}

absolute | All other elements on the page will ignore the element and act like
  it is not present on the page.  The element will be positioned relative to
  its closest positioned parent element. Can use the 4 properties above.

fixed | remains in a fixed position, regardless of scrolling

z-index | Controls overlap priority with 1 being highest.
